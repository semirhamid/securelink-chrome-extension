# Secure Link Chrome Extension üõ°Ô∏è

Secure Link is a Chrome Extension designed to enhance your browsing security by identifying and preventing users from clicking on suspicious links. It utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze links on web pages and determine their level of safety.

## Installation

You can install the Secure Link Chrome Extension from the Chrome Web Store by following these steps:

1. Go to the Chrome Web Store page for Secure Link Extension: [Secure Link Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/secure-link/your-extension-id)
2. Click on the "Add to Chrome" button.
3. Confirm the installation by clicking "Add Extension" in the pop-up window.

## How it Works

Once installed, the Secure Link Extension runs silently in the background of your browser. When enabled, it scans the links on the current webpage in real-time. It employs machine learning models to analyze various factors such as URL structure, domain reputation, and content to determine the safety of each link.

If a suspicious link is detected, the extension will visually highlight it or display a warning message, depending on your settings. This helps users to avoid potentially harmful websites and phishing attempts.
